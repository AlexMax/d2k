# To Do

  1. Fill out the handler functions
    * Probably involves creating some new methods/enums/etc.
  2. Finally revamp `d_client.c` and `d_server.c`.
  3. Add command-line arguments for new netcode.
    * `-serve <host>:<port>`
      * Also enables headless mode.
    * `-connect <host>:<port>`
    * host & port will live for now until HTTP/JSON comes online; let's get a
      prototype out first.
